# Exploring why agile methods work

## knowledge refineries
software development teams are knowledge refineries.
software starts with somebody having a need.
this need unfolds in an idea, a vision.
in a traditional world this vision leads to the creation of requirements.
the requirements are used to create specifications.
the specifications guide the writing of the code.
each of these steps could be seen as refinements of knowledge.
the knowledge starts very vague and becomes gradually more specific until it ends in code.
the knowledge is transferred, refined, stored, and it decays

## preventing knowledge loss through fluctuation
code reviews, pair programming, mob programming.

## communication
communication is lossy.
bugs in code, specifications, requirements and ideas.
a waterfall process hides bugs until the last possible moment, it maximizes the risk of bugs, and the damage those bugs inflict.
idea to code asap.
iterate in smaller batches.

### #NoMeetings
rip you out the zone.
currently unrelated things discussed.
expensive to get back into the zone again.
discussed things are forgotten by the time they are needed.

### #NoEmails
send and forget.
often used as documentation, but bad fit.

## Essentials
Make sure to keep improving and becoming gradually more agile.
