# Automated Development Environment

This session was mainly about showing what an automated development environment (DevEnv) is and some pointers on how such a DevEnv could be created. The main goal is to have the same development conditions for every developer on a project so that one can easily set up a new development machine but also easily reproduce bugs of version X of a project. The demonstration case was the DevEnv at Symflower which uses a virtual machine managed by Vagrant which then runs all tools also found in the final product (Docker, Kubernetes, ...) plus development and especially debugging tools.
